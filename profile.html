                    My name is Thoeurn Phen, and I was born and raised in Kirimeanun Village, a peaceful community in Siem Reap Province, Cambodia. My journey started with a passion for learning, which led me to earn a degree in Information Technology. But education alone wasn‚Äôt enough‚ÄîI wanted to make a real impact.
I began my professional career in education, teaching math to children and supporting community programs. Over the years, I grew into leadership roles in production, retail, and operations. I‚Äôve had the opportunity to manage teams, lead projects, coordinate franchise development, and support executive decision-making. Whether it's designing business plans, supporting IT systems, or helping a bakery expand its reach, I bring passion and precision to every task.
I‚Äôm also a proud father of two boys and a lifelong learner who believes in growth through challenge. In every job, my goal is to contribute meaningfully, build strong relationships, and bring value to both people and processes.
